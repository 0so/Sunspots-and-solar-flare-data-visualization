# Sunspots-and-solar-flare-data-visualization

This Jupyter notebook creates visualizations of the sunspot cycle from data gathered since circa 1950. </br>
The Python libraries used to achieve this were Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.</br>
The first section shows the sunspot cycles which are graphed by the number of recorded sunspots and the amount of 10.7 radio flux emanated from sunspots, which are then compared to show a direct correlation.</br>
Afterwards, solar flares recorded by the GOES satellites since 1997 are formatted and graphed in a stacked histogram by class categorization (only C, M, X class flares).</br>
The video included in the data folder, captured by SDO, represents the strongest solar flare recorded in the year 2021 as of December 3rd, 2021. </br>
The video is shown in conjunction with line graph illustrating the day where the most flux in the 10.7 frequency was at its peak that year on October 28th 2021.</br>
This project also shows string manupulation from 20 raw .txt files which were transformed into a Pandas dataset for ease of graphing and analysis.</br>
</br>
The sunspot datasets were gathered by AAVSO and graphing was done with the help of Timothy Bull.</br>
The GOES flare data was gathered and archived by NOAA.</br>
